      <h3>GestureHome</h3>
      <p>GestureHome is an innovative home automation system that allows users to control devices through hand gestures,
        utilizing the Raspberry Pi. Designed to assist individuals with limited mobility, the system enables seamless
        control of lights, fans, and speakers via a user interface displayed on a monitor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Utilizing OpenCV and MediaPipe, GestureHome captures real-time video through the Raspberry Pi camera to track
        hand positions and movements. This process identifies the coordinates of 21 hand points, allowing users to
        navigate menu options with the index fingertip. Additionally, the distance between the thumb and index finger
        can be measured to adjust settings like light brightness, speaker volume, and fan speed. The system effectively
        translates these hand motions into precise control commands for various devices.

      <h3>Time Ball</h3>
      <p>In the 19th and early 20th centuries, ships used time balls to synchronize their chronometers by dropping a
        large ball from a mast at noon, allowing sailors to set their clocks accurately before long voyages. The Titanic
        Memorial Lighthouse, built in 1913, featured a time ball that dropped daily at noon, and today’s famous example
        is the New Year's Eve Ball Drop in Times Square, inspired by this tradition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inspired by historic time balls, Professor Skovira and I are developing a Raspberry Pi-powered replica. This
        version uses 3D-printed gears, bicycle chains, and Python to mimic the original’s noon drop. Our project merges
        history and technology while honoring the legacy of the South Street Seaport time ball, and we plan to showcase
        it at the South Street Seaport Museum on Titanic Remembrance Day.

      <h3>OCaml Travel</h3>
      <p>A terminal-based application that scrapes data from websites providing bus services such as MegaBus and OurBus
        and outputs all available routes based on user input. This application will also have filtering features based
        on start date, end date, time, location, price, and relevancy. The application will eventually have some form of
        automatic ranking system to rank all available bus routes for the user based on the parameters entered.</p>
